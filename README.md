## Key Aspects of the Competitor Sales Analysis Project:

### 1. Data Transformation
- **Transforming Raw Data**: Cleaned and transformed raw data into a format suitable for analysis, handling missing data, transforming column types, and making sure the dataset is ready for further processing.

### 2. Loading Data
- **Loading Data**: Loaded data from multiple sources (such as CSV and Excel), ensuring that the dataset contained all necessary information.
  
### 3. Append Queries
- **Combining Data**: Used the **Append Queries** technique to combine data from multiple sources into a single dataset. This is crucial when merging competitor sales data from different regions or periods.

### 4. Optimizing Model
- **Optimizing Model**: Improved the performance of the Power BI model by reducing the complexity of relationships and applying techniques to reduce the size of the data, ensuring reports run efficiently.

### 5. Setting Up Relationships
- **Building Relationships**: Created relationships between tables (e.g., **Sales**, **Product**, and **Competitor** tables), allowing the analysis of data across different dimensions.

### 6. Discovering Business Insights
- **Top N Analysis**: Performed **Top N Analysis** to identify the highest-selling products, top competitors, or regions with the most growth.
  
- **Sales Trend Analysis**: Analyzed sales data over time to identify patterns such as increasing or decreasing sales performance, seasonality, and forecasting.

### 7. DAX Measures and Calculations
- **This Year vs Last Year**: Calculated **Year-over-Year (YoY)** comparisons to see how this year's sales compare to last year's.
  
- **% Growth Calculation**: Used **DAX** to create **percentage growth** measures to analyze how sales have grown between different periods.

- **Market Share Analysis**: Calculated each competitor's **market share** by dividing their sales by the total market sales, providing a comparative view of each company's standing in the market.

### 8. Creating a Data-Driven Story

- **Storytelling with Bookmarks and Buttons**: Created interactive report elements using **bookmarks** and **buttons** to guide users through different views of the data, transforming the report into an engaging **story** that helps users navigate insights.

- **AI-Based Visuals**: Leveraged **AI-powered visuals** in Power BI, such as **Key Influencers** or **Decomposition Tree**, to identify the main drivers behind sales performance and explore the data in a more advanced way.
